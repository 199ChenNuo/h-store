PE Triggers: demohstorenocleanup vs demosstorepetrigonly
(only tests the PE triggers, everything else identical)
S-Store gets about 2X throughput

EE Triggers: hstoreeetrigtest vs sstoreeetrigtest
(only tests the EE triggers. S-Store version uses a join, but it should be very low cost)
EE triggers gain very little throughput.  Joins counteract the gain, and actually lead to a net loss.

Tuple Windows: winhstorenocleanup vs winsstore
(only tests the tuple window difference)
H-Store always performs better than S-Store in experiments
H-Store throughput doesn’t change much with changing window and slide size
S-Store performs comparably for W100S10, but performance drastically degrades as window size increases

Time Windows: wintimehstorenocleanup vs wintimesstorewinonly
(only tests the time window difference)
H-Store always performs better than S-Store, usually around 1.75X
H-Store and S-Store performance doesn’t change drastically with window size, slide size, and ts size
I believe this is because we are copying every tuple into a separate window table

Voter Demo: demohstorenocleanup vs demosstore
(full demo test)
S-Store is still performing substantially better than H-Store (around 8X)
part of this is the PE triggers (2X)
I’m not yet sure what the rest of this is…

Overall, I think our windowing implementation (and general approach) is killing us here.  The problem is that our windows require us to keep two copies of the data: one in the real table, one in the window table.  Also, maintaining the pointers may be a little expensive since everything is already in memory.  One way around this would be to maintain the pointer chain IN the actual table itself.  So when we’re making a window on the Votes table, we can maintain the pointer without needing to make a copy of the data.  Obviously we would need to essentially implement views in H-Store.

I’m wondering if “INSERT INTO.. SELECT” is as efficient as we think it is.  I’d like to run some tests on this.

I’d also like to see if EE triggers give us any benefit at all.

NEXT: figure out why VoterDemoSStore is still performing so well
run tests on windows only, without keeping a full copy of the data
