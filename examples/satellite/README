The satellite example is a simulation of satellite tracking. The example contains two client applications:

- signal.Client - Simulates a data collector, pushing location information into the database with 0.1 second delays
- tracker.UserInterface - Simulates a tracker, that queries to database every 3 seconds and graphically shows where the satellites are on a world map.

The supplied build.xml file assumes that you have the VoltDB distribution installed in /opt/voltdb.  If this is not the case you must modify the following line in build.xml and set it to the directory where the VoltDB distribution is installed.

    <property name='volt.dir' location='/opt/voltdb' />


The easiest way to run the example is to use ant to build and run it:

	ant  		   builds the applications and compiles the catalog
	ant server	   runs the database server
	ant tracker    runs the tracking client (tracker.UserInterface)
	ant client 	   runs the signal.Client with 5 satellites.

It is also possible to run multiple signal.Client applications, so you can demonstrate in real-time that the tracker is pulling data out of the database (as new satellites appear on the map). 
To customize the signal.Client, you can specify the number of satellites it simulates and their country of origin:

	java signal.Client <n> <country>

Where <n> is any positive integer and <country> is one of the following: brazil, china, france, india, or usa.

NOTE: You must set your CLASSPATH prior to executing the above command (such as "export CLASSPATH=/opt/voltdb/voltdb.jar:obj/").
