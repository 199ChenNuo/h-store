The auction example is a VERY simple on-line auction simulation.

The auction-ddl.sql file describes the following tables:
- Category (types of things that can be auctioned)
- Item (actual things that are auctioned)
- User (buyers and sellers)
- Auction (one record per auction, including a start time equal to the creation time of the record and an end time 2 minutes later)
- Bid (all of the bids for all of the auctions)

A client is provided that runs various Java stored procedure files to:
- Load categories, users, and items from the category,txt, user.txt, and item.txt datafiles into the appropriate tables.
- Load 4 auctions from the auctions.txt file into the auction table and initiate the auctions.
- Provide bids by various users for each auction, using an algorithm for creating a new bid price based on the previous bid for the item adjusted by an increase based on the starting price and a random Gaussian function. Each auction completes within 1 to 2 minutes after the auction starts. 
- Provide periodic status on each auction.
- Provide the results of each auction after close.
