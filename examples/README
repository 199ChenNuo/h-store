% Examples Guide

Example Projects
================
The following projects are included in the examples directory:

auction
  This example contains a set of schema, clients, and procedures for running auction related transactions. 

browser_adhoc
  This example application allows for execution of adhoc SQL from within a web browser using the Python client library.

satellite
  This example is a simulation of satellite tracking.


When appropriate, each example includes a DDL file and a project.xml that lists the DDL file and the stored procedures names.

ant -p will print a description of the available targets in each example directory. 'client' and 'server' are the targets you can use to run a client and server for each example. 

To run a example project, from within the examples/example_of_choice directory:
- in a terminal window, run ant (no target) to compile the Java and example catalog
- then run ant server, to start the VoltDB server
- then, in a separate terminal window, run ant client, where you will see the results
- when complete, hit Ctrl C in the server terminal window to exit the VOLT DB

Generating a skeleton project
=============================
A stripped down skeleton project can be created by running the "generate" python script and passing it the name of the project, the Java package prefix to be used for the generated source files, and the destination directory. The script is not very robust so check args and permissions carefully and don't include a '.' at the end of the package prefix.
